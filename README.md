Add 4 new inserters:
* Magnetic Stack inserters
* Magnetic Long Reach Stack inserters
* Magnetic Filter Stack inserters
* Magnetic Long Reach filter Stack inserters

There are no animations which allows the inserters to work at a significant speed boost. A great companion to fast belts.

Balance may need be adjusted. These inserter use a lot of power. Some of the graphics are a little off but the difference is minor.
