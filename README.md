Add 4 new inserters:
* Ultra Fast Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Long Reach Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Filter Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Long Reach filter Stack inserters

Version 0.1 adds a new exprimental inserter:
* Ultra Fast configurable inserters
** UFCI allows to chose which lane to pick-up and dropoff items. pickup is always even due to only beign able to pickup from a whole belt.
* Removing the word Magnectic - gets the name a bit shorter

There are no animations which allows the inserters to work at a significant speed boost. A great companion to fast belts.

Balance may need be adjusted. These inserter use a lot of power. Some of the graphics are a little off but the difference is minor.
