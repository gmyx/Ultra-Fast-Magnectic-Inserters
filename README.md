Add 6 new inserters:
* Ultra Fast Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Long Reach Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Filter Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Long Reach filter Stack inserters
* Ultra Fast Configurable inserters
* Ultra Fast Configurable filter inserters

Version 0.1 adds a new exprimental inserter:
* Ultra Fast configurable inserters
** UFCI allows to chose which lane to pick-up and dropoff items. pickup is always even due to only beign able to pickup from a whole belt.
* Removing the word Magnectic - gets the name a bit shorter

Version 0.1.1
* Change default to no stack, which makes the inserters faster - it doesn't have to wait for a stack
* Added settings to allow the user to control
* Ultra Fast configurable Filter inserter
* * Same as the configurable, but with filters

There are no animations which allows the inserters to work at a significant speed boost. A great companion to fast belts.

Balance may need be adjusted. These inserter use a lot of power. Some of the graphics are a little off but the difference is minor.
